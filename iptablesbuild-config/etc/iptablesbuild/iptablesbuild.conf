### SYSTEMS ###
#
# All product areas that are to have an iptables configuration generated are listed here.
# 
# These stanzas all represent an individual system or group of systems using the same config file. Variables declared within these stanzas are unique to the config one builds for them.

#	Here are a few sample configurations for hosts.

# Templates are small "chunks" of iptables configurations. 
# Each template offers access through a specific port or ip address, depending on the purpose of the template.

# Templates with "INPUT" or "inc" in the name are for incoming rules.
# Templates with "OUTPUT" or "out" in the name are for outgoing rules.
# NOTE: The above naming convention is for our convenience. iptablesbuild doesn't actually care what a template is 
# called as long as the name is unique.

#template definitions can be found at this location
